# Guide-Dog-Feedback-Arudino-Code

Written for another students Industrial Design Capstone project. Simply allowed you to hold a button on a remote and buzz the specific haptic motor. The goal of his project was to have map directions given to guide dog users using haptic feedback in place of audio thus freeing there hearing sense. The haptic feedback motors were embeded in a 3d printed handle for the dog.
